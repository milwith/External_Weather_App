# External_Weather_App
Develop a Spring Boot application to process and analyze weather data from an external API while demonstrating advanced Spring features like asynchronous execution and caching.

1. Fetches weather data for a given city using an external weather API (like
OpenWeatherMap).
2. Processes and analyzes the data to:
o Compute average temperatures for the last 7 days.
o Determine the hottest and coldest days.
3. Caches the results for each city to reduce API calls.
4. Exposes a single REST endpoint for fetching the weather summary.
